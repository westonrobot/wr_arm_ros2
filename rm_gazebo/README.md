## rm_gazebo_Package_Description
rm_gazebo is mainly used for realizing the simulation function of robot arm Moveit2 planning. We build a virtual robotic arm in the simulation environment of Gazebo, and then control the virtual robot arm in Gazebo through Moveit2. This package is introduced in detail in the following aspects.
* 1.Package use.
* 2.Package architecture description.
Through the introduction of this part, it can help you:
* 1.Understand the package use.
* 2.Familiar with the file structure and function of the package.
Source code address: https://github.com/RealManRobot/ros2_rm_robot.git。
## rm_gazebo_Package_Running
### Control_of_the_simulation_robotic_arm
After the installation of the environment and the package, we can run the rm_gazebo package.  
Use the following command to launch the Gazebo virtual space and the virtual robotic arm.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo gazebo_65_demo.launch.py
```
The command to start the six-axis force version of the manipulator is (note: eco63 is not available):
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo gazebo_<arm_type>_6f_demo.launch.py
```
The command to start the integrated six-axis force version of the manipulator is :
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_gazebo gazebo_<arm_type>_6fb_demo.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models of the robotic arm are 65, 63, eco65, 75, and gen72. The interface displays as follows after successful running.

Then, we use the following command to launch moveit2 to control the simulation robot arm in Gazebo.
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_<arm_type>_config gazebo_moveit_demo.launch.py
```
The command to start the six-axis force version of the manipulator is (note: eco63 is not available):
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_<arm_type>_config gazebo_moveit_demo_6f.launch.py
```
The command to start the integrated six-axis force version of the manipulator is :
```
rm@rm-desktop:~$ ros2 launch rm_<arm_type>_config gazebo_moveit_demo_6fb.launch.py
```
In practice, the above <arm_type> needs to be replaced by the actual model of the robotic arm. The available models of the robotic arm are 65, 63, eco65, eco63, 75, and gen72.   
After the control interface of rviz2 pops up, you can perform the simulation control of moveit2 and Gazebo.
